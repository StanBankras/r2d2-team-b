## Problem

Our current team website shows us but it doesn't allow us to chat while we are on this webpage, thus we decided add a real-time chat functionality.

## Solution

To implement this we will consider using socket.io for a real-time connection and have a discussion platform on our website.
For this we need the following **dependencies**:

- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) Unopinionated web framework for node.
- [Socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io) Real-time bi-directional event-based communication.

To create a basic 'chatbox' the easiest way would be to create a form with an unordered list. The list will get children whenever a user sends a message.

### Socket.io

Our implementation of socket.io is relatively simple, it follows the example on [socket.io](https://socket.io/get-started/private-messaging-part-1/) and the [example Justus showed us](https://github.com/ju5tu5/barebonechat).

The clients navigate to our website and are greeted with our faces and a chatbox on the rightside (desktop format). This established a socket connection that persists with each connected user. Everytime someone sends a message socket.io relays this event to the other clients.

### Coding Style

To have a basic styleguide in our code we will make use of linters.

### Static files

To have the application as simple as possible we will be serving the golden trio, HTML, CSS and JS.
The express server sends the HTML to the client's browser which in turn interprets it and shows our wonderful faces.

### Heroku
We have been using the automatic deployment feature of heroku.
The one thing we had to take care of is using a process environment variable for the port. This way Heroku decides which port it can use.
```JS
  const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
```
## Insights
The following insights have been generated while discussing and developing this project:

- Socket.io is a bi-directional event based communication method.
- We going to write a lot of markdown.
- Real-Time-Web is the most technological project of this minor.
- We will work in a Readme-Driven Development (RDD).
