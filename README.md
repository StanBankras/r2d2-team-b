# REAL TIME WEB

## Problem

Our current team website shows us but it doesn't allow us to chat while we are on this webpage, thus we decided add a real-time chat functionality.

## Solution

To implement this we will consider using socket.io for a real-time connection and have a discussion platform on our website.
For this we need the following **dependencies**:

- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) Unopinionated web framework for node.
- [Socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io) Real-time bi-directional event-based communication.

To create a basic 'chatbox' the easiest way would be to create a form with an unordered list. The list will get children whenever a user sends a message.

### Socket.io

### Coding Style

To have a basic styleguide in our code we will make use of linters.

### Static files

To have the application as simple as possible we will be server the golden trio, HTML, CSS and JS.
The express server sends the HTML file to the client's browser which in turn interprets it and shows our wonderful faces.

### Heroku
